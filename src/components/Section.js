              The moment a colleague, mentioned that Abe, was going to expose
              his system I immediately signed up...what Abe has been able to
              create for himself in his career, there's not question why not to
              learn from him... If you want to be successful, learn from those
              that have done it before you, this is your opportunity to learn
              from a top producing agent... Abe out delivered, he exposed his
              system and approach to building a pipeline and how to structure
              yourself to follow up... Follow up is the meat of your
              business...and Abe shows how it is done.

              This course is phenomenal. I wish I could have done it on day 1
              when I got into the business. I'm so thankful for abe safa making
              this course because he had solutions for everything I was running

              office, Jan. I was top producing agent in my office, and in Feb. I
              was top listing agent in my office. I know Greg's course played a
